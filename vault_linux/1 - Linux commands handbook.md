This Linux command handbook will explain some of the basic commands you should know as a software developer.

Before listing the commands here is a short introduction to Linux and Bash.

## What is Linux?

Linux is an operating system, just like Windows and MacOS.

More precisely, with the term Linux we refer to the lowest-level core component (called kernel) of an operating system.

Starting from those core functionalities, a set of distribuitions have been built over time, commonly called *Linux distros*, such as for example Debian and Ubuntu.

The Linux kernel was created in 1991 by Linus Torvald, starting from UNIX, an operating system which was first developed in the 1960s.

Torvald intent was to have a free software, restricted to use as commercially and for this reason he placed Linux under the GNU General Public License (originally introduced in 1989 by Richard Stallman, the creator of GNU, an UNIX-like OS), which basically means that you may freely copy, change, and distribute it, but you may not impose any restrictions on further distribution, and you must make the source code available for everyone.

Nowadays Linux is recognized as one of the most popular OS and its distribuitions are widely used for both professional and common purposes.

## What is Bash?

Bash is a command line interface (also called command line shell), a text-based instructions interpreter that serves to work straight with the underlying operating system.

Bash was developed as a free alternative to a proprietary software, Bourne Shell (created by Steve Bourne and mainly known as *sh*), intended to serve as command line shell for Linux-based operating systems. Bash stands for Bourne Again Shell.

There are several shells we can use to execute Linux commands, Bash is one of the most popular and is available for many operating systems.
